        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm a graduate of Electronics Engineer and passed my licensure examination last October  2019. I've been polishing my skills since college and have been finding ways to become a Software Engineer. Equipped with perseverance and eagerness to learn, I use my time to further enhance my knowledge during this quarantine to become productive and to make this pandemic problem an opportunity for self improvement.</p>
        <p>As a Full Stack Software Engineer, my aim is to find a career path suitable for my skills and interests like programming. I am also aiming to become a Data Engineer.</p>
